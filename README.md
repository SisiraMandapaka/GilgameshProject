# GilgameshProject
This is meant to replicate something of the way in which my thoughts flowed as well while reading Utanapishtim's thoughts on mortality in The Epic of Gilgamesh, and the way in which the text “houses” them, so to speak. The associations I make with each line are present, but you can also skip around in a non-linear fashion and see later connections I made with the initial connections, if that makes sense.
